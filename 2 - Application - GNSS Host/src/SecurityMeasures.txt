Security Measures for NSS:

1. Disable Screen Access
	> users shouldn't access the screen (JWindow)
	
2. Disable task manager and cmd
	> task manager will be exited if opened. (use taskkill command in cmd)
	
3. Disable USB Removable Drives (gpedit.msc)
	> USB drives cannot run applications on insertion
	
4. NSS will run on startup (use task schedule for faster startup)
	> even if the unit was rebooted, it will still run its security measures
	
5. NSS will not close on shutdown (gpedit.msc)
	> windows will not ask to exit GNSS before shutting down.

6. NSS will disable exit hotkey (Alt+f4) in session (JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE)
	> the window will ignore the exit hotkey (Alt+f4)
	
7. Disable alt+tab (Robot)
	> lock screen must be always on front
	> disables the alt key temporarily
	
8. Closes explorer.exe (taskkill)
	> explorer.exe will be temporarily closed to prevent win key usage and other resources
