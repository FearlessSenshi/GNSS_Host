Security Measures for GNSS:

1. Disable Screen Access
	> users shouldn't access the screen (JWindow)
2. Disable task manager and cmd
	> task manager will be exited if opened. (Process.getRuntime() )
3. Disable USB Removable Drives (gpedit.msc)
	> USB drives cannot run applications on insertion 
4. GNSS will run on startup
	> even if the unit was rebooted, it will still run its security measures
5. GNSS will not close on shutdown (gpedit.msc)
	> windows will not ask to exit GNSS before shutting down.
